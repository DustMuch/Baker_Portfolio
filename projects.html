			    <p>Explanation of the Project:
<p>The reason for this project is that we understand how to use the tools that we learned by making a character of our choosing. I chose Cartman to draw on.</p>
              <P>Project Reflection:
I think that this project really help me understand how the tools work and when I should use the tools. Doing the assignment was very entertaining to me since I get to draw a character from my choosing in illustrator.</p>

			    <p>Explanation of the Project:
This is a practice test that we had to do in class for Graphic Design. The test is about how to use Illustrator and what's used for.
</p>
        <p> Project Reflection: I think that doing this test was worth it. This test help me understand how to use the software and learn new things about illustrator.</p>

            <p>Explanation of the Project:
The objective of this project is that we have to think of an app. It's basically trying to come up with an app that will be use in any devices. We had to present this project to our class and dressed professionally.  </p>

            <p>Explanation of the Project:
This project is about describing a font in detail and tell the characteristics of the font. Everyone had to present their font in front of the class.</p>
<p>Project Reflection:
To be honest, I think that this project was a waste of time. I kind of understand that we had to understand like what font it is or if it's part of a family. I think that we should've been tested in this then doing a presentation of it.</p>

                <p>Explanation of the Project:
The class had to do a Project that was about a Greek hero's story. Everyone had to work with a group and write about the hero's journey of the hero that we were assigned to. We had to present the hero's journey in front of our class.</p>
    <p>Project Reflection:
I had a lot of fun doing this project. I worked with people that I didn't know and helping them in this project. I also learned new things about the Greek hero that we were working on.</p>

                <p>Explanation of the Project:
The goal of this project is to use different color scheme on each side of the picture. We were required to use warm colors, cool colors, Complementary Colors, and analogous color. I worked with three other people doing this project.
</p>
    <p>Project Reflection:
I thought this project was really fun. The reasons why is that we get to choose what picture to do the color scheme on. I also worked with new people I haven't met before. </p>

                    <p>Explanation of the Project:
This project was about coloring a side of an object to see what kind of pattern it makes on the paper. In this case I used my shoe to be the surface to color on the paper. </p>
        <p>Project Reflection:

                        <p>Explanation of the Project:
This project is about writing summaries of news that happens around the world. No one can write about any news that it was one month old. We also had to put our feedback about the news like if it was either good news or bad news.
</p>
            <p>Project Reflection:
I really enjoyed doing this project because it made me more interested about what's happening around the world. The news that I've come across is really horrible. </p>

This was a exam that I had to take for my major class. In order for me to pass it I would need to show my knowledge about on Adobe Photoshop. </p>
